# Hurricane Wind Speed Prediction

This project tracks the route of hurricanes and predicts the wind speed based on pressure data using a linear regression model. The goal of this project is to analyze hurricane data, visualize the hurricane's path, and build a model that can predict wind speed using pressure as a feature.

## Files

- **`src/`**: Contains Python scripts for tracking the hurricane's path and building the prediction model.
- **`data/`**: Contains the dataset used for the analysis.
- **`report/`**: Contains the detailed project report in PDF format.

## Overview

The project is divided into the following sections:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the hurricane dataset.
2. **Hurricane Tracking**: Plot the path of a specific hurricane and visualize it on a map.
3. **Prediction Model**: Build a linear regression model to predict wind speed based on pressure data.
4. **Visualization**: Generate plots to visualize the relationships between pressure, wind speed, and the hurricaneâ€™s path.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tilakkumar13/Hurricane_Wind_Speed_Prediction.git

2.Install the Required Dependencies: To install the required libraries, run the following command:
 
	pip install -r requirements.txt

3.Run the Scripts: You can analyze the hurricane data and build the model by running the Python scripts from the src/ directory.
